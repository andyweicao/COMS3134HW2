First type "javac *.java" to compile all the files. 
Then type "java FindPalindromes palindromes.txt" to see the results.
If you use other .txt files, just put it into the directory and type the name after the "FindPalindromes".
When building the stack, I used the linkedlist style and modified every linkedlist node as a "cell" in the code and manually construct it.
